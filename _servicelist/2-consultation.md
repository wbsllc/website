Worthington Behavioral Services offers private pay Parent Training in Applied Behavior Analysis to families awaiting an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and/or ABA therapy with a provider. We understand the importance of starting therapy as soon as possible and the frustration families face while awaiting a diagnosis or when being placed on waiting lists for ABA therapy. This service is offered to assist families with the transition into ABA therapy.
