Worthington Behavioral Services offers BCBA coverage for temporaray medical leaves up to 12 weeks. This service is offered to alleviate the stress and burnout ABA providers can experience during staffing shortages. We believe in supporting therapy providers by planning for anticipated staffing shortages so that providers are better prepared to face the challenges that may arise due to unanticipated staffing shortages. WBS understands the importance of providing consistent quality services to individuals impacted by autism and strives to support others in minimizing disruptions to services related to staffing concerns. 

**Advanced scheduling is required, so contact us today if you are interested!**
