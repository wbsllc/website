**What is autism?**

Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by challenges with social skills, restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, and delays in communication. While individuals with ASD may have similar characteristics related to their diagnosis, each person will have their own set of challenges and should receive individualized treatment based on their needs. 

**What is ABA and how will it help my child?**

Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is the application of the principles of behavior to issues that are socially significant to produce practical change. ABA can help an individual to overcome behavioral challenges, improve communication, and gain new skills. 

**What diagnosis do you need to receive ABA therapy?**

The behavioral principles used in ABA have application for all human behavior. However, ABA therapy is most recognized as a medically approved treatment for individuals with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis.

**What qualifies someone to provide ABA therapy?**

There are 3 levels of providers recognized and credentialed to practice in the field of ABA by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB). These are:
1.)	Registered Behavior Technician (RBT), 
2.)	Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst (BCaBA), and
3.)	Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA). 

The RBT is responsible for providing 1:1 ABA therapy to an individual for the recommended number of hours. RBTs are required to be 18 years of age, have a high school diploma, pass a background check, complete 40 hours of training in ABA, complete the initial competency assessment, and pass the BACB’s RBT examination to receive their certification. RBTs are required to receive ongoing supervision from a BCaBA or BCBA, adhere to the BACB’s Code of Ethics, and renew their certification annually to continue to work as an RBT. 

The BCaBA can provide supervision to RBTs and make treatment recommendations for individuals receiving ABA therapy. A BCaBA is required to receive ongoing supervision from a BCBA. BCaBAs are required to hold a bachelor’s degree, complete behavior analytic coursework, and complete the necessary hours of supervised fieldwork to be eligible to take the BACB’s certification exam. Once credentialed, a BCaBA must meet continuing education requirements, receive ongoing supervision, adhere to the BACB’s Code of Ethics, and recertify every 2 years to continue to work as a BCaBA. 

The BCBA supervises any RBTs or BCaBAs responsible for providing treatment to an individual receiving ABA therapy. The BCBA is responsible for completing individualized assessments and making treatment recommendations. The BCBA works closely with staff, caregivers, family members and others involved in an individual’s treatment. The BCBA is required to hold a master’s degree, complete behavior analytic coursework, and complete the necessary hours of supervised fieldwork to be eligible to take the BACB’s certification exam. Once credentialed, a BCBA must meet continuing education requirements, adhere to the BACB’s Code of Ethics, and recertify every 2 years to continue to work as a BCBA. Some states, like Wisconsin, require that a BCBA hold a state license to practice.

**Can someone who does not have an autism diagnosis receive ABA therapy?**

Yes, if the individual’s family seeks private pay options. Insurance companies require documentation of an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis from a medical provider for treatment to be covered by insurance. 

**How long after receiving an autism diagnosis can services begin?**

The sooner the better! Unfortunately, families often experience setbacks in getting started with ABA therapy due to insurance issues and/or provider availability. 

**What services do Worthington Behavioral Services LLC offer? Are these services offered to anyone with an autism diagnosis? Why is it important to offer these services?**

On an individual basis, Worthington Behavioral Services LLC (“WBS”) provides private pay Parent Training in ABA to families awaiting an autism diagnosis or ABA therapy with a provider. Starting ABA therapy as early as possible is important for children who are suspected to have an autism spectrum diagnosis and often families experience delays in starting therapy due to awaiting the evaluation and diagnosis or being placed on an ABA provider waitlist following diagnosis. Parent Training provides families with the skills they need to help their loved ones during this waiting period. 
WBS also offers temporary BCBA coverage for ABA providers experiencing staffing shortages related to temporary leaves of absence. WBS understands the importance of limiting disruptions to services for individuals with autism and seeks to provide aid to ABA providers during staffing shortages. 

**How is your organization different from others?**

WBS was founded with the purpose of helping families and professionals during times that ABA services may not be available or may be disrupted for uncontrollable reasons. WBS is passionate about helping individuals and families impacted by autism and wants to offer services that enhance the quality, availability, and effectiveness of treatment. 

**Will you work with my child’s other providers and with the school?**

Yes, we are happy to work with any other professionals or caregivers involved in an individual’s care! This includes daycare, school, other therapy providers (ST/OT/PT), and the transition to an ABA provider. 

**Do you offer services in the evening or on the weekend?**

WBS offers services Monday through Friday from 9am to 3pm. If necessary, other arrangements may be available in certain circumstances for an additional fee. 

**Will you come to my home?**

Yes, WBS offers services in the home and community settings. 

**Does insurance cover ABA? Do you accept and file health insurance?**

Yes, most insurances cover ABA therapy for individuals with an autism spectrum diagnosis. WBS does not accept and bill insurance as this would limit the individuals that WBS would be able to help early in the diagnosis process. 

**Why do you require a referral for Parent Training if you do no bill insurance?**

WBS wants to create meaningful and collaborative relationships between providers and families, and this starts at the beginning of the journey! By having your medical provider or future ABA provider refer your child to WBS you open the lines of communication between your child’s providers to ensure that your child receives the appropriate care from the start.
