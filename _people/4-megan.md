Megan received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Sound Design from Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia. After graduating they stayed in Georgia to pursue a career working in theater and performance art. After spending several years in the theater industry, they realized they had a desire to be outdoors teaching children about nature and agriculture. Megan spent most of their childhood and adolescence participating in a girl scout program that introduced them to how wonderful and rewarding nature and learning can be. A desire to share this love of the outdoors led them to pursue a Master of Science in Outdoor and Environmental Education at Alaska Pacific University. Megan is currently working towards completing a K-8 graduate teaching certificate in Alaska. They have worked with a variety of age groups from 5-13 years old, as well as young adults involved in internship programs. 

When Megan is not studying or teaching, they enjoy reading, cooking, and farming. They also love spending time with family, traveling, and learning about other cultures.  

Megan works part-time as a Community Outreach Coordinator at Worthington Behavioral Services LLC.
