For over a decade, Jessica has worked with individuals and families impacted by autism, developmental disabilities, and other complex medical needs. Her path to ABA started during her time in medical genetics with the internationally acclaimed Greenwood Genetic Center. Here she became intimately aware of the growing need for qualified providers of services for families impacted by autism spectrum disorders. Jessica began her pursuit of certification as a Behavior Analyst in 2018 and gained invaluable experience working for a large nonprofit ABA company in South Carolina prior to moving with her family to Wisconsin in 2021. She has a special interest in parent and provider training, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), and treatment of challenging behaviors. 
        
Jessica values spending time with her family, supporting others, and seeking opportunities for personal and professional growth.
