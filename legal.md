**About This Notice**
We are required by law to maintain the privacy of Protected Health Information and to give you this Notice explaining our privacy practices regarding that information. You have certain rights – and we have certain legal obligations – regarding the privacy of your Protected Health Information, and this Notice also explains your rights and our obligations. We are required to abide by the terms of the current version of this Notice. 

**What Is Protected Health Information?**
“Protected Health Information” is information that individually identifies you and that we create or get from you or from another health care provider, health plan, your employer, or a health care clearinghouse and that relates to (1) your past, present, or future physical or mental health or conditions, (2) the provision of health care to you, or (3) the past, present, or future payment of your health care. 

**1. How We May Use and Disclose Your Protected Health Information**
You will be asked to sign a consent form. Once you have consented to use and disclosure of your Protected Health Information for treatment, payment, and health care operations by signing the consent form, your ABA provider will use or disclose your Protected Health Information as described in this Section 1. Your Protected Health Information may be used and disclosed by your ABA provider, our company staff, and others outside of our company that are involved in your care and treatment for the purpose of providing health care services to you.

We may use and disclose your Protected Health Information in the following circumstances:

**For Treatment:** We may use or disclose your Protected Health Information to give you medical treatment or services and to manage and coordinate your medical care. For example, your Protected Health Information may be provided to a physician or other health care provider (e.g., a specialist or therapist) to whom you have been referred to ensure that the physician or other health care provider has the necessary information to diagnose you, treat you, or provide you with a service. We may also disclose your Protected Health Information to another ABA provider or health care provider who, at the request of your ABA provider, becomes involved in your care by providing assistance to your ABA provider with your diagnosis or treatment. 

**For Health Care Operations:** We may use and disclose Protected Health Information for the health care operations of Worthington Behavioral Services LLC. We may use your Protected Health Information to internally review the quality of the treatment and services you receive and to evaluate the performance of our employees in caring for you. As part of health care operations at Worthington Behavioral Services LLC we also may disclose information to BCBAs, BCaBAs, RBTs, or other therapy team members and other authorized personnel for educational and learning purposes. For example, we may disclose your Protected Health Information to BCBA/BCaBA/RBT Trainees who serve clients at our company. 

We may also use or disclose the Protected Health Information, as necessary, to provide you with information about possible treatment options or alternatives or health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you. 

**Minors:** We may disclose the Protected Health Information of minor children to their parents or guardians unless such disclosure is otherwise prohibited by law.

**To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety:** We may use and disclose Protected Health Information when necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health or safety or to the health or safety of others. But we will only disclose the information to someone who may be able to help prevent the threat. 

**Business Associate:** We may disclose Protected Health Information to our business associates who perform functions on our behalf or provide us with services if the Protected Health Information is necessary for those functions or services. For example, we may use another company or private provider to provide consulting services for us. All of our business associates are obligated, under contract with us, to protect the privacy and ensure the security of your Protected Health Information. 

**Military Activity and National Security:** If you are a member of the armed forces, we may disclose Protected Health Information as required by military command authorities. We also may disclose Protected Health Information to the appropriate foreign military authority if you are a member of a foreign military. If you are involved with military, national security or intelligence activities or if you are in law enforcement custody, we may disclose your Protected Health Information to authorized officials so they may carry out their legal duties under the law. 

**Workers’ Compensation:** We may use or disclose Protected Health Information for workers’ compensation or similar programs that provide benefits for work-related injuries or illness.

**Legal Proceedings:** If you are involved in a lawsuit or a dispute, we may disclose Protected Health Information in response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other legal process from someone else involved in the dispute, but only if efforts have been made to tell you about the request or to get an order protecting the information requested.

**2. Your Rights Regarding Your Protected Health Information**

You have the following rights, subject to certain limitations, regarding your Protected Health Information:

**Right to Inspect and Copy:** You have the right to inspect and copy Protected Health Information that may be used to make decisions about your care. We have up to 30 days to make your Protected Health Information available to you and we may charge you a reasonable fee for the costs of copying, mailing or other supplies associated with your request. Under federal law, however, you may not inspect or copy the following records: psychotherapy notes; information compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or use in, a civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding, and Protected Health Information that is subject to law that prohibits access to Protected Health Information. Depending on the circumstances, a decision to deny access may be reviewable. In some circumstances, you may have the right to have this decision reviewed. Please contact our company owner if you have any questions about access to your health record. We may not charge you a fee if you need the information for a claim for benefits under the Social Security Act or any other state or federal needs-based benefit program. We may deny your request in certain limited circumstances. If we do deny your request, you have the right to have the denial reviewed by a licensed healthcare professional who was not directly involved in the denial of your request, and we will comply with the outcome of the review. 

**Right to an Electronic Copy of Electronic Medical Records:** If your Protected Health Information is maintained in an electronic format (known as an electronic medical record or an electronic health record), you have the right to request that an electronic copy of your record be given to your or transmitted to another individual or entity. We will make every effort to provide access to your Protected Health Information in the form or format you request if it is readily producible in such form or format. If the Protected Health Information is not readily producible in the form or format you request your record will be provided in either our standard electronic format or if you do not want this form or format, a readable hard copy form. We may charge you a reasonable, cost-based fee for the labor associated with transmitting the electronic medical record. 

**Right to Get Notice of a Breach:** You have the right to be notified upon a breach of any of your unsecured Protected Health Information.

**Right to an Accounting of Disclosures:** You have the right to ask for an “accounting of disclosures” which is a list of the disclosures we made of your Protected Health Information.

Your request must state the specific restriction requested and to whom you want the restriction to apply. If your ABA provider believes it is in your best interest to permit use and disclosure of your Protected Health Information, your Protected Health Information will not be restricted.

With this in mind, please discuss any restriction you wish to request with your ABA provider. 

**Right to Request Confidential Communications:** You have the right to request that we communicate with you only in certain ways to preserve your privacy. For example, you may request that we contact you by mail at a specific address or call you only at your work number. You must make any such request in writing to our company owner.
